# Requirements

## Introduction

Soul aim of the project is to digitize the process of maintianing records at an level of indivisual Universities. Instead of keeping physical records which can be damaged or lost, saving records in a file. Also to keep track of student academic performance at given universities.

## LITERARY SURVEY
Most colleges and universities and some private schools offer a pass/fail grading system for at least some of their courses. In some institutions, pass/fail is the only option for some or all of their courses. Student grading system is different from the traditional five-interval grading system that gives students A, B, C, D or F grades to give them an idea of their academic standing and progress This system of a clear boundary between making the grade or falling short has benefits for students individually as well as collectively. 

 ## TYPES OF GRADING 
 * Mastery Grading 
 * Grading Scale 
 * Letter Grades
